popoto-0.0.a5
 2015-04-25

    - Modified default label provider to display all returned attributes with their value by default in the result list instead of constraint attribute only.

    - Added different CSS classes for ellipses when value is selected for root and choose nodes. Also added disabled style on root node if no results are found in the database.

popoto-0.0.a4
 2015-04-19

    - Transition to transactional Cypher HTTP endpoint. Cypher queries are now executed using transactional HTTP endpoint instead of deprecated legacy API.

    - Count query optimization, all count queries are now sent on the same REST call using a list of statements. (better performance on distant databases)

    - Added new CSS styles for nodes and links when count is "0" (disabled node state)

    - Added new property "popoto.graph.WHEEL_ZOOM_ENABLED" to disable zoom with mouse wheel on graph.

    - Added properties to add/disable tool items in graph.

    - Introduced new property "popoto.query.USE_RELATION_DIRECTION" to define whether or not generated Cypher queries will use directed relationship.

    - Added a plus sign icon button on nodes to get relationships instead of right click. Right click is now only used to remove a selection.

    - Added a minus sign icon button on nodes after relation have been expanded. click on this button will remove all the relations from this node.

    - Added reset graph tool option.

    - Added different CSS classes on relation links to be able for example to differentiate links with value ("ppt-link-relation" and "ppt-link-relation value").

    - Added a new property "popoto.graph.link.RADIUS" to define the radius around the node to start link drawing (nicer on transparent node images).

    - Refactored node svg generation to fully support dynamic type changes (e.g use SVG node type for node label and image for selectable values)

    - Added different CSS classes on node highlight background circle (shown on node hover) to be able to customize it depending on node type.

    - Added listener on root node add event to allow for example to set a specific value on root node when added.

    - Added immutable state on nodes to be able to add unchangeable constraint on graph. Immutable nodes value constraints are used in relations query which will avoid relation on nodes with 0 values.

    - Added configuration to allow filter of relations. This can be used to hide unwanted relation from the graph.

    - Added configuration to define whether the list of relation with same parent label should be grouped or separated using last child label with the property popoto.query.USE_PARENT_RELATION.
      The generated Cypher query use head(labels(x)) or last(labels(x)) to get the relation target node label.

popoto-0.0.a3
 2015-03-26

    - Fixed constraint generation in query for root node with non string attributes. (double quotes were always used in Cypher generation on root node constraint even for numeric and boolean values)

    - Added a taxonomy label provider and extracted a few internal labels to fully support localization.

    - Extracted node text y position in variable to be able to customize it

    - Extracted some internal labels to allow localization

    - Extracted popoto.graph.centerRootNode function to allow root node move after HTML component resize for example

    - Added node shadow highlight on node hover

    - Used text value on node title instead of semantic value

popoto-0.0.a2
 2015-03-16

    - Updated AJAX request body to execute Cypher queries on Neo4j REST API with authentication support.
    Neo4j 2.2 and GrapheneDB are now supported with this change.
    Transition to the new transactional endpoint is not yet ready, legacy Cypher HTTP endpoint is still used in this version.

    - Added sort attribute in configuration for value query.
    It is now possible to use the constraint attribute to sort the values displayed on node click instead of count (count is still used by default).
    The order can also be specified to be ascending or descending.

    - Removed default returned internal Neo4j id if any other attribute is provided in configuration.
